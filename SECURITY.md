# Security Policy

This repository is a **simulation-only** teaching/demo artifact.

- It is **not** a security product.
- It performs **no** real network calls, shell execution, or file writes by design.
- Please do not file vulnerability reports expecting deployment fixes.

If you have a suggestion that improves clarity or enforcement of the simulation-only constraints,
open an issue describing the change and rationale.
